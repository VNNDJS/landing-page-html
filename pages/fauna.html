            <p class="fauna_param">Madagascar’s fauna is incredibly diverse and unique, with around 90% of its wildlife
                being endemic. The island is famous for its lemurs, such as the ring-tailed lemur and the indri, which
                are found nowhere else on Earth. Other notable animals include the fossa, a carnivorous mammal
                resembling a small cougar, and the aye-aye, a nocturnal primate with a distinctive long middle finger
                used for foraging.</p>

                <p>
                
                Madagascar is also home to a variety of reptiles, including the smallest chameleon,
                Brookesia nana, and numerous species of geckos and snakes. The island’s isolation has allowed these
                species to evolve independently, resulting in a rich and unique ecosystem
